Project Title: HelpBridge Donation Management System



Introduction





HelpBridge Donation Management System is a platform designed to provide timely and organized support during crises such as natural disasters, pandemics, and extreme poverty situations. In many emergency cases, aid efforts face problems like poor coordination, lack of transparency, and delays in reaching the people in need. HelpBridge aims to solve these challenges by connecting donors, support seekers, volunteers, and admin in a single system.





The system allows donors to contribute essential items, while support seekers can submit requests for help. An admin oversees the entire process, manages crises, and assigns volunteers to monitor and verify donations and requests. This ensures that the right resources reach the right people at the right time.





HelpBridge emphasizes accountability, efficiency, and transparency in donation management, ultimately building a bridge between generous contributors and individuals in need.
